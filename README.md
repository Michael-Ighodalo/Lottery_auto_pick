it would login to the lottery site, 
pick the numbers from a list and send it for processing. 
now most sites may vary, some have a timeout of 20 seconds or more to prevent you from buying more than a allocated amount within the specified time, hence the timer in the code. 
I hope to add a trained random number generator soon.
